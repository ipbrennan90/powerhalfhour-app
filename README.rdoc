Power Half Hour App (Associations, Authentication, ActiveRecord, Nested Routes)

It would be great if we could start having students run some of the power-half hour sessions in the afternoons.

Build an app that would help organize this. I think it would be cool if users could post topics they would like to see covered in 30 minute segments, and then a single user could "claim" that subject and lead us through a 30 minute talk/demo of said topic.

Super open ended, just another idea to help reinforce the idea of deliberate practice involving the things we are covering in class.

Maybe instead of "Power Half Hours", we call these "Thunderstorm Talks" (╯°□°)╯
